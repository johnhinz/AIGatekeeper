# AiGateKeeper

The goal of this library is to design a tool that would watch a folder for specific files, send them to an AI dicovery tool and take some action if an appropriate subject is found.
The library has abstracted the AI dicovery tool and the repository.  There are implementations for DeepStack [Link](https://deepstack.cc/)  and MQTT [Link](https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet).
